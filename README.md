*Echo AI Router* addresses one of AI’s growing inefficiencies: using massive models for simple tasks.
 - Why drive a truck to deliver a postcard?

Echo AI Router is a smart model-routing system that automatically picks the lightest viable model for each request, optimizing for speed, cost, and sustainability without compromising quality.

Built on FastAPI, it features a query analyzer that classifies prompts by intent and complexity, and a ranker that scores models based on task fit, latency, cost, and carbon footprint.

It integrates seamlessly with Hugging Face and local inference endpoints, supported by real-time telemetry and monitoring dashboards for performance and energy metrics.
